The Acme Air sample application shows an implementation of a fictitious airline called "Acme Air".
The application was built with the some key business requirements:
       the ability to scale to billions of web API calls per day, the need to develop and deploy the application in public clouds (as opposed to dedicated pre-allocated infrastructure), and the need to support multiple channels for user interaction (with mobile enablement first and browser/Web 2.0 second).
